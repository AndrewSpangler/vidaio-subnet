# vidAIo: Revolutionizing Video Upscaling with AI-Driven Decentralization on the Bittensor Ecosystem

## Introduction

### 1.1. Our Mission
vidAIo's mission is to democratize video enhancement through decentralization, artificial intelligence, and blockchain technology. Leveraging the Bittensor ecosystem, vidAIo provides creators, businesses, and developers with scalable, affordable, and high-quality video upscaling solutions while ensuring full ownership and control over their content.

### 1.2. Abstract
vidAIo addresses the growing demand for high-quality video content by introducing a decentralized, AI-driven video upscaling platform. Built on the Bittensor ecosystem, vidAIo disrupts traditional centralized solutions that are costly, resource-intensive, and inaccessible to many. By utilizing advanced AI and machine learning, vidAIo offers scalable, cost-effective, and high-quality video enhancement services.

### 1.3. Problem Statement
Centralized video upscaling solutions face significant challenges:
- **High Costs**: Expensive infrastructure and proprietary tools inflate prices.
- **Limited Accessibility**: Small creators and businesses are often excluded due to restrictive licensing models.
- **Scalability Issues**: Traditional systems struggle to meet growing demand.
- **Quality Limitations**: Many solutions fail to deliver high-quality results, especially for low-resolution or compressed videos.

### 1.4. vidAIoâ€™s Solution
vidAIo decentralizes video upscaling to:
- **Reduce Costs**: Up to 80% cheaper with a pay-as-you-go model.
- **Enhance Control**: Ensures creators maintain ownership of their intellectual property.
- **Improve Scalability**: Decentralized architecture handles demand spikes without costly upgrades.
- **Leverage AI**: Advanced AI ensures continuous improvement in video quality and efficiency.

#### Key Features
- **AI-Powered Upscaling**: Transform low-resolution videos into high-definition formats.
- **Fair Pricing**: Transparent, usage-based pricing with no hidden fees.
- **API-First Design**: Seamless integration for developers and businesses.
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Eliminates single points of control, enhancing security and reliability.

## Subnet Architecture

### 2.1 Overview
- **Miners**: Handle video upscaling tasks and optimize models to ensure high-quality outputs.
- **Validators**: Assess miner performance using predefined metrics to maintain network integrity.

### 2.2 Miners
Miners enhance video quality using AI-driven upscaling techniques. They can:
- Optimize open-source models or develop proprietary ones for superior results.
- Handle video upscaling requests from validators and end-users.

### 2.3 Validators
Validators ensure miners deliver consistent, high-quality results by evaluating performance through synthetic and organic queries.

### 2.4 Synapses
#### 2.4.1 Synthetic Query
Validators benchmark miner performance using controlled datasets:
- Downscale a 4K video to HD.
- Miners upscale the HD video back to 4K.
- Validators assess the upscaled output using metrics like TOPIQ and latency.

#### 2.4.2 Organic Query
Real-world video data uploaded by users is processed as follows:
- Videos are chunked and queued for miners.
- Miners process and upscale the chunks.
- Results are aggregated and delivered back to users.

## Roadmap

### Phase 1: Implementing the Upscaling Synapse
- Launch the subnet with AI-powered video upscaling.
- Focus on real-time processing of low-quality videos into high-definition formats.

### Phase 2: Developing an AI-Powered Video Compression Model
- Build AI models for adaptive bitrate streaming.
- Optimize bandwidth usage while maintaining video quality.

### Phase 3: Implementing the Transcode Optimization Synapse
- Introduce AI-driven transcoding for compatibility across devices.
- Evaluate miners on speed, quality, and efficiency.

### Phase 4: On-Demand Streaming Architecture
- Enable decentralized on-demand video streaming with integrated storage.
- Utilize peer-to-peer (P2P) models for redundancy and high availability.

### Phase 5: Live Streaming Through the Subnet
- Introduce live streaming with real-time AI-powered upscaling and transcoding.
- Integrate adaptive bitrate streaming for smooth playback.

### Phase 6: Subnet API for Real-World Integration
- Develop a RESTful API for seamless integration with external platforms.
- Include features for uploading, processing, and retrieving videos.
